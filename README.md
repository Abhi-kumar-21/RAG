# Agentic RAG
Overview
Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a flexible and scalable framework designed to enable dynamic, multi-node chains for processing large language models (LLMs). This implementation integrates LangChain and LangGraph to allow efficient external API integration, asynchronous operations, and advanced state management for optimal context retention and query processing.

Features
Cyclic, Multi-Node Agentic RAG: Dynamically connects multiple nodes and external APIs, optimizing the retrieval and generation pipeline.
Asynchronous Operations: Built-in async capabilities to handle large-scale queries efficiently.
State Management: Conditional routing and enhanced state handling for improved context retention in complex LLM tasks.
Integration with LangChain and LangGraph: Leveraged these tools to create a modular, easily extensible framework.
Key Components
External API Integration: Seamlessly integrate third-party APIs for real-time data retrieval and processing.
LCEL (Logical Chain Execution Layer): Ensures optimized execution of complex chains by managing the flow of data across multiple nodes.
Conditional Routing: Routes different inputs to specific pathways based on the query context, enhancing accuracy and reducing latency.
